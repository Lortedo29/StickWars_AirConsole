# StickWars_AirConsole  
  
## Game Concept
Characters are stickmen locked in a computer.

The winner is the first to 8 kills.
Characters can interact with the computer, like creating a new platform or releasing a virus!

## History
StickWars is a portage of my baccalaureat project, created in JS.
I am really happy to improve and correct my game developing errors made 2 years ago!

## Tech
I am using **AirConsole** to make my game playable in multiplayer with smartphones.
